# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This is my internship Task 5 . This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using the **Heart Disease dataset**.

**Objective**

- Train a Decision Tree and visualize it
- Control model overfitting
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest
- Compare accuracy between models
- Interpret feature importances
- Use cross-validation for evaluation

**Dataset**

- File: heart.csv
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

**Tools Used**

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook 

 **Steps Performed**

1. **Loaded and cleaned the dataset**
2. **Trained a Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Visualized the tree structure**
4. **Limited tree depth to reduce overfitting**
5. **Trained a Random Forest Classifier**
6. **Compared accuracy of both models**
7. **Plotted feature importances**
8. **Evaluated models using cross-validation**
